# Todo Application

This is a simple todo application that allows you to create, delete and mark tasks as done. It is built using React and has a Vite base. Vite is a build tool that is faster than Webpack and has a smaller bundle size. It also has a dev server that is faster than Webpack's dev server. It is also built using JavaScript (JSX). This is a simple application that is meant to be a learning experience for me. I am using this application to learn React and Vite. I will be adding more features to this application as I learn more about React and Vite. I will also be adding more features to this README as I learn more about writing READMEs. Currently I am using the [PurpleBooth](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2) README template.
